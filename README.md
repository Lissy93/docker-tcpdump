### Usage  
  
```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/dump --tty --net=container:<container_name> lissy93/tcpdump tcpdump -i any -w /dump/dump.pcap
```

Where `<container_name>` is the running container you would like to analyze, and `dump.pcap` is the output filename.

Once you've finished captureing traffic, open the pcap file in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), or your favorite packet analyzer.

You can also run any other [`tcpdump`](https://www.tcpdump.org/)  commands in a similar way, like `docker run lissy93/tcpdump tcpdump [commands]`.

The container is published on DockerHub under [lissy93/tcpdump](https://hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/tcpdump), but if you prefer you can also build the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Lissy93/docker-tcpdump/blob/main/Dockerfile) yourself.
